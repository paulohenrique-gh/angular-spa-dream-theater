    Dream Theater was formed under the name Majesty by Petrucci, Myung and
    Portnoy — all natives of Long Island, New York — while they attended Berklee
    College of Music. They dropped out to concentrate on the band. Petrucci and
    Myung have been the only two constant members. Portnoy had remained until
    2010, when he was replaced by Mike Mangini after deciding to leave to pursue
    other musical projects before rejoining Dream Theater in October 2023. After
    a brief stint with Chris Collins, followed by Charlie Dominici (who was
    dismissed from Dream Theater not long after the release of their first
    album), LaBrie was hired as the band's singer in 1991. Dream Theater's first
    keyboardist, Kevin Moore, left the band after three albums and was replaced
    by Derek Sherinian in 1995 after a period of touring. The band recorded one
    album with Sherinian, who was replaced by current keyboardist Jordan Rudess
    in 1999.

    Dream Theater has released fifteen studio albums. The band's highest-selling
    release is their second album Images and Words (1992), which reached No. 61
    on the Billboard 200 chart. The albums Awake (1994) and Six Degrees of Inner
    Turbulence (2002) also entered the charts at No. 32 and No. 46 respectively,
    and each received critical acclaim. Their fifth album, Metropolis Pt. 2:
    Scenes from a Memory (1999), was ranked number 95 on the October 2006 issue
    of Guitar World magazine's list of the greatest 100 guitar albums of all
    time. It was also ranked as the 15th Greatest Concept Album in March 2003 by
    Classic Rock magazine.
