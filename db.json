      "instrument": "Vocals",
      "bio": "In 1990, LaBrie learned that Dream Theater was looking for a new singer, so he submitted a tape and was quickly flown to New York for a full audition. The trial went well, and he was chosen ahead of 200 other hopefuls to fill the full-time vocalist position in the band.\n\nLaBrie has since had a significant impact on the vocal melodies on each Dream Theater album, but until recently has had little input on the instrumentation of Dream Theater's music - 2011's A Dramatic Turn of Events features LaBrie in the music credits on three songs. To date he has written or co-written lyrics for at least one song on eight of the twelve albums Dream Theater has released with him in the band, Images and Words, Black Clouds & Silver Linings, Dream Theater and The Astonishing containing none of them.\n\nAsked by Prog-Sphere.com what is his favourite Dream Theater song to play live, James said \"The favourite song for me is Scarred, I love performing that live. And... well, Octavarium, that whole freakin’ thing.\"",

His first was the progressive rock supergroup Platypus, with Rod Morgenstein, Ty Tabor and ex-Dream Theater bandmate Derek Sherinian. After Platypus disbanded in 2000, Myung, Tabor, and Morgenstein recorded four albums as the Jelly Jam.\n\nMyung's favorite bands include the Beatles, Black Sabbath, the Who, Iron Maiden, Rush, Yes, Jethro Tull and Genesis. He cites bassists Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, Chris Squire, Steve Harris, Geddy Lee and Jaco Pastorius as the main influences on his playing style.",

He developed a preference for bands like Rush, Queen, Led Zeppelin, The Who, Iron Maiden, and The Beatles.\n\nAfter high school, where he played in a band called Inner Sanctum, he received a scholarship to attend the Berklee College of Music in Boston. There, he met John Petrucci and John Myung, and together they formed a band initially named 'Majesty' before becoming Dream Theater.\n\nPortnoy was a founding member and served as the drummer for Dream Theater for 25 years, known for his complex rhythms and energetic performances. He left the band in 2010 but reunited with them in October 2023, replacing drummer Mike Mangini.",
